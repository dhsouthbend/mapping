# More Resources

I hope you have enjoyed this brief QGIS exercise and that this has helped you understand a bit better how GIS works and some of the things you can do with these applications. But don’t stop here! There’s much more to learn and there are plenty of resources online to help you learn more about QGIS. The first stop for you would be the [GIS Practicum](http://guides.newman.baruch.cuny.edu/gis) developed by Frank Donnelly of Baruch College. Also, don’t forget to check out the [Raster Tutorial](https://www.baruch.cuny.edu/confluence/display/geoportal/QGIS+Raster+Tutorial) which will elaborate on alternatives ways of using Digital Elevation Maps and useful plugins. [The GIS Lounge](https://www.gislounge.com/) also has plenty of resources to learn GIS for free.

# Other Functions You May Be Interested In
* Geocoding: This function takes addresses to create a new points layer. [Click here for more information on Geocoding](http://www.stevencanplan.com/2010/10/automatic-geocoding-has-arrived-to-qgis/)
* Dissolve: removes the boundary between two polygons, making two overlapping shapes one
* Intersection: creates a layer for overlapping points, polygons, or lines
* Centroid: Similar to a polygon to points feature, it creates a layer of points in the center of each polygon
* You can also calculate attributes such as distance, area, etc.

# Places to Get Spatial Data

Remember that you can download many Shapefiles and Raster Images for free online, that you could find by doing Google searches or looking in specific sites, such as the [Indiana State Data site](http://www.stats.indiana.edu/), [the US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography.html), or [these recommendations from GIS Geography](http://gisgeography.com/best-free-gis-data-sources-raster-vector/).
