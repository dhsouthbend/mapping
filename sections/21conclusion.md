# Conclusion 
We covered a lot today! Some of the concepts we learned today are:

* how to add vector layers from shapefiles
* how to add raster layers from shapefiles
* how to add a basemap
* how to add a new layer and draw features
* how to create new layers using clipping, buffers, and other geoprocessing tools
* how to generate attributes
* how to change symbology 
* how to create a map

## More Resources

I hope you have enjoyed this brief QGIS exercise and that this has helped you understand a bit better how GIS works and some of the things you can do with these applications. But don’t stop here! There’s much more to learn and there are plenty of resources online to help you learn more about QGIS. The first stop for you would be the [GIS Practicum](http://guides.newman.baruch.cuny.edu/gis) developed by Frank Donnelly of Baruch College. Also, don’t forget to check out the [Raster Tutorial](https://www.baruch.cuny.edu/confluence/display/geoportal/QGIS+Raster+Tutorial) which will elaborate on alternatives ways of using Digital Elevation Maps and useful plugins. [The GIS Lounge](https://www.gislounge.com/) also has plenty of resources to learn GIS for free.

Other resources of interest may be another QGIS tutorial specific to humanities [“Mapping Literary Space in QGIS”](http://www.meredithgoldsmith.com/qgistutorial/) and [Stackexchange has a qgis section](http://qgis.stackexchange.com/). 


Remember that you can download many Shapefiles and Raster Images for free online, that you could find by doing Google searches or looking in specific sites, such as the [NY State Data site](https://data.ny.gov/), [the US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html), or [these recommendations from GIS Geography](http://gisgeography.com/best-free-gis-data-sources-raster-vector/).
